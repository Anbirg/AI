## üî¨ Projects

### 1. Binary Image Classification using CNN

* üìÇ [View project](Deep_Learning_Final_Project.ipynb)
* **Tools:** `Python`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `sklearn`, `seaborn`, `PyTorch`
* **Description:**
  The dataset consists of synthetically generated images. Some of these contain various artifacts such as text, hands, fingers, mask fragments, tattoos, or eyes not facing the camera.
  The goal of this project was to train and evaluate a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model capable of accurately performing binary image classification. This project is designed as a **Kaggle-style challenge** to optimize model performance and improve image recognition skills.

### 2. Text Representation and Classification (NLP)

* üìÇ [View project](SarcasmDetection.ipynb)
* **Tools:** `Python`, `json`, `numpy`, `pandas`, `sklearn`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`
* **Description:**
  This project focuses on detecting **sarcasm in news headlines**.
  I built a text classification pipeline that vectorizes textual data, trains a machine learning model, and classifies headlines as either *sarcastic* or *non-sarcastic*. The work demonstrates skills in **natural language processing**, **feature engineering**, and **model evaluation**.

### 3.Bank FAQ Chatbot (NLP)
‚Ä¢ üìÇ [View project]](_FAQ_Bot.ipynyb_)
‚Ä¢ Tools: Python, pandas, sklearn, nltk, json
‚Ä¢ Description:
This project implements a chatbot designed for a banking environment to automate responses to frequently asked customer questions.
The bot uses natural language processing techniques to understand user queries and provide accurate answers to common banking-related topics such as account information, transactions, and services.
It demonstrates skills in text preprocessing, intent recognition, and conversational AI development.
